## Q-transformer

Implementation of <a href="https://qtransformer.github.io/">Q-Transformer</a>, Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning via Autoregressive Q-Functions, out of Google Deepmind

I will be keeping around the logic for Q-learning on single action just for final comparison with the proposed autoregressive Q-learning on multiple actions. Also to serve as education for myself and the public.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install q-transformer
```

## Usage

```python
import torch

from q_transformer import (
    QRoboticTransformer,
    QLearner,
    Agent,
    ReplayMemoryDataset
)

# the attention model

model = QRoboticTransformer(
    vit = dict(
        num_classes = 1000,
        dim_conv_stem = 64,
        dim = 64,
        dim_head = 64,
        depth = (2, 2, 5, 2),
        window_size = 7,
        mbconv_expansion_rate = 4,
        mbconv_shrinkage_rate = 0.25,
        dropout = 0.1
    ),
    num_actions = 8,
    action_bins = 256,
    depth = 1,
    heads = 8,
    dim_head = 64,
    cond_drop_prob = 0.2,
    dueling = True
)

# you need to supply your own environment, by overriding BaseEnvironment

from q_transformer.mocks import MockEnvironment

env = MockEnvironment(
    state_shape = (3, 6, 224, 224),
    text_embed_shape = (768,)
)

# env.init()     should return instructions and initial state: Tuple[str, Tensor[*state_shape]]
# env(actions)   should return rewards, next state, and done flag: Tuple[Tensor[()], Tensor[*state_shape], Tensor[()]]

# agent is a class that allows the q-model to interact with the environment to generate a replay memory dataset for learning

agent = Agent(
    model,
    environment = env,
    num_episodes = 10000,
    max_num_steps_per_episode = 1000,
)

agent()

# Q learning on the replay memory dataset on the model

q_learner = QLearner(
    model,
    dataset = ReplayMemoryDataset(),
    num_train_steps = 10000,
    learning_rate = 3e-4,
    batch_size = 32
)

q_learner()

# after much learning
# your robot should be better at selecting optimal actions

video = torch.randn(2, 3, 6, 224, 224)

instructions = [
    'bring me that apple sitting on the table',
    'please pass the butter'
]

actions = model.get_optimal_actions(video, instructions)

```

## Todo

- [x] first work way towards single action support
- [x] offer batchnorm-less variant of maxvit, as done in SOTA weather model metnet3
- [x] add optional deep dueling architecture
- [x] add n-step Q learning
- [x] build the conservative regularization
- [x] build out main proposal in paper (autoregressive discrete actions until last action, reward given only on last)
- [x] improvise decoder head variant, instead of concatenating previous actions at the frames + learned tokens stage. in other words, use classic encoder - decoder
    - [x] allow for cross attention to fine frame / learned tokens
- [x] redo maxvit with axial rotary embeddings + sigmoid gating for attending to nothing. enable flash attention for maxvit with this change
- [x] build out a simple dataset creator class, taking in the environment and model and returning a folder that can be accepted by a `ReplayDataset`
    - [x] finish basic environment loop
    - [x] store memories to memmapped files in designated folder
    - [x] `ReplayDataset` that takes in folder
        - [x] 1 time step option
        - [x] n-time steps
- [x] handle multiple instructions correctly
- [x] show a simple end-to-end example, in the same style as all other repos
- [x] handle no instructions, leverage null conditioner in CFG library
- [x] cache kv for action decoding
- [x] for exploration, allow for finely randomizing a subset of actions, and not all actions at once
    - [ ] also allow for gumbel based sampling of actions, with annealing of gumbel noise

- [ ] consult some RL experts and figure out if there are any new headways into resolving <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cebly/Papers/CONQUR_ICML_2020_camera_ready.pdf">delusional bias</a>
- [ ] figure out if one can train with randomized orders of actions - order could be sent as a conditioning that is concatted or summed before attention layers
    - [ ] offer an improvised variant where the first action token suggests the action ordering. all actions aren't made equal, and some may need to attend to past actions more than others
- [ ] simple beam search function for optimal actions
- [ ] improvise cross attention to past actions and states of timestep, transformer-xl fashion (w/ structured memory dropout)
- [ ] see if the main idea in this paper is applicable to language models <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/llama-qrlhf">here</a>
