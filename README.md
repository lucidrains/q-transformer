## Q-transformer (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://qtransformer.github.io/">Q-Transformer</a>, Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning via Autoregressive Q-Functions, out of Google Deepmind

## Appreciation

- <a href="https://stability.ai/">StabilityAI</a>, <a href="https://a16z.com/supporting-the-open-source-ai-community/">A16Z Open Source AI Grant Program</a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/">ðŸ¤— Huggingface</a> for the generous sponsorships, as well as my other sponsors, for affording me the independence to open source current artificial intelligence research

## Todo

- [x] first work way towards single action support

- [ ] build out main proposal in paper (autoregressive discrete actions until last action, reward given only on last)
- [ ] do n-step Q learning, even though not that big of improvement
- [ ] figure out the conservative regularization, read prior work
- [ ] add dueling architecture, just to get more RL experience
- [ ] add double Q + pessimism support
- [ ] improvise a cross attention variant instead of concatenating previous actions? (could have wrong intuition here)
- [ ] see if the main idea in this paper is applicable to language models
- [ ] consult some RL experts and figure out if there are any new headways into resolving <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cebly/Papers/CONQUR_ICML_2020_camera_ready.pdf">delusional bias</a>
